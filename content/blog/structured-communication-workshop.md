## About

This is a 3-part workshop, designed to practice focussed and effective communication.
The approach is communicative and task-focussed, emphasising practice over theory.
The minimum number of participants is three, with one leader, though more can be accomodated with grouping.

The workshop should fit within a couple of hours, though a short break in inbetween sections is possible.

The session is designed to be run in-person, though it should be adaptable to hybrid and remote.

## Outcomes

- Understand how to communicate a point in a structured way.
- Able to, with time, prepare and deliver a point concisely and clearly.

## Lesson Plan

### Introduction/Warm up

Introduce the term "hot takes".
Ask them to think what some of theirs are.
Give some examples of lightly contentious takes [examples](#example-hot-takes).

Take 2 minutes individually to write down at least three hot takes about anything.
Takes should be one per bullet point, in full sentences, and should stand alone.
More than three is just fine, and the time might run long, ours took five minutes.
If anyone is struggling, prompt them to think of a familiar argument they have with their friends,
or something that would get their parents or spouse angry about.

Run a plenary session, where each person shares one hot take each.
Hopefully some entertaining discussion ensues but don't let it get too heated or divergent.
After each person has shared there hot take, they should mark the bullet point to show that it's been used.

### Practice 1 - Free Practice

Introduce the concept of persuasive writing, many will have encountered this in high school.
Acknowledge introductions and conclusions, but that they will be ignored today, as the bulk of the communication is the body.
We'll be imitating the structure of the body, and using it to enhance spoken communication.

1. One (and only one) main point
1. Corollary or cause
1. Example
1. Optional repeat of 2 and 3
1. Tie back to main point

Touch on primacy, recency, and rebuttal.
Primacy - Bottom Line Up Front, recency - the tie-back, and rebuttal to settle doubts.

Present an example hot take using this structure, but orally [example](#demonstration-hot-take-paragraph).
Observe the clarity and concision of the point.
Then bring a text copy up on screen, note the sections together.
Explain that while some people can talk like this (politicians, scientists?), it is a skill we can practice.

Individually, from their list of hot takes, select a second one and mark it.
Individually, take 7 minutes to write a paragraph, with similar structure to the above, communicating their hot take.
Emphasise that these don't have to be full sentences or perfect prose, but the structure is important.
The time limit is also not strict here, but does help people get a move on.

In a group, present your hot take to the group.
Reading off the notes is fine for this, as the aim is to practice ordering thoughts.
Listeners should see if they can pick out any supporting points, as well as any points that _didn't_ work well in support e.g. unrelated, poorly explained.

### Practice 2 - Under Pressure

This is the final stage.
Participants trade their remaining hot take points to the person on their left, face down.
When you receive a set of hot takes, leave them face down.
The time limit for this section is more strict, as the intention is to practice a little closer to the pace of thinking required for conversational level.
My time limit was the second-last person in the group finishing, you may need to adapt this.
The task is to select one of the hot takes not marked/used, and write it up in the structured style same as before.
Same no need for full sentences, focus on structure.
The fun of this one is seeing someone else's hot takes, and having to maybe deliver a point you disagree with.

After completion, individuals present "their" hot take to the group.
This time, after all hot takes are delivered, listeners collectively discuss and agree on their favorite hot take presentation.
If doing multiple groups, follow this up with a plenary where each group presents their selected hot take.
This will generate some general feedback and chatter.

### Conclusion

Round out the session by commenting on how this applies to technical points, and presenting in a professional context.

## Appendix

### Example Hot Takes

- Designating clothing as men's or women's shouldn't be allowed
- Mocktails are just juice for adults
- Sydney wishes it was Brisbane (insert $city here as needed)
- Pizza is a healthier breakfast than cereal
- Video games are better at storytelling than most movies
- Pasta is Chinese food, not Italian

### Demonstration Hot Take Paragraph

Tea should be constructed milk-first, *then* hot water.

It brews better.
Yes, the initial temperature goes down more at first, but the loss overall is less since the thermal difference with ambient temperature is less for longer.

Milk is the important part of the tea.
If your mug is too full of water, it has an outsized impact if you can't put as much milk as you want.

[rebuttal]
Some people would boil the milk with the tea.
This makes too much tea, and is too much effort, you might as well make soup.

Overall the science *and* the taste say add milk first to tea.

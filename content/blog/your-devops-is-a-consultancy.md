# Your DevOps Team is a Consultancy

Many words have been spilled about DevOps and DevOps teams.
This post assumes some familiarity with the tired arguments like;
DevOps isn't a team
DevOps isn't part of the org structure
DevOps is just a buzzword

If you were here for those, sorry.

DevOps/Platform Engineering is a consultancy.

And it should be managed as such.

The fact is that internal platforms, most of them, could be co-owned by multiple internal functions, to better meet the needs of all users.
It's effective governance and the systems thereof that prohibit this.

How often have you had to interact with an HR or marketing system that seemed to eb totally alien to your needs as a user from a different discipline?
Domain-specific jargon, workflows that are arcane, an unfamiliar UX...

This is not just a DO/PE issue, many internal products and services suffer from not being co-owned.
Co-ownership encourages more engagement with the applications, distributes enhanement workload, and generates actionable ffedback readily.
In fact, the users can action it themselves!
With the proliferation of configuration-as-code, any user can contrubute to the settings of the application they are dissatisfied with!

But first, a distinction, and clarification.

Platform Engineerining (PE hereafter) is a bit of a buzzword at the time of writing.
For this post, PE is distinct from DevOps in that it is philosophically about developer self-service, and collaboration.

No platform is built without requirements.
(well, actually, they can be, and are, sometimes, but not with good results)
The aim of a platform team is Pareto glide.
Solve for 80% of the company's developer workflows and use cases, and call it the golden path.

So, about this consultancy then?

Consultancies are often based around a suite of products and technologies that they garner and hone proficient talent in.
WiPro with SAP is a common example.
Consultancies offer... well, often anything you'll apy them for.
But lets boil this down.

Case A: Your client is completely new to everything - you provide full implementation.
You gather requirements, design solutions, implement, maybe there's even a budget for QA and training (ha!)

Case B:
Client is somewhat familiar with the suite, you offer to tackle some of the unknown unknowns, sharp areas and hairy chasms.
You can rely on them for some basic architecture and configuration, but they still need some hand-holding.
The dark is scary, after all.

Case C:
Client is clueless.
Has no idea what's available.
Has no idea what they want or how any of this could form into a solution that fits them.

There's talk of internal products, when it comes to PE.
This is only part of the story.
Developers don't simply buy your product.
They're coerced into it!
Imagine trying to sell your manager on "well, yes we have $thing in-house, but let me just reinvent it cause we don't like /this/ part and we know better"
So lesson 0 - you're already in an ausive relationship.
Try not to lean into it.
Next - developers actually maybe interested in your solution?
Onboarding?
Bait-docs?
Docs at all?
Doc quality?
Peer trainers?
Testamonials? Social capital? Technical capital?
Legitimate capital (be careful, mandates are shiiit)

End result, you've ~maybe~ an actual product?
but in most all cases you're actually acting as a consultancy for said product
T-shirt sizing of handholding, inviting developers to contribute

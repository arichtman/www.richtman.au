# What's Up Doc?

- Multitudes of solutions
- Complexity not reducing
- Same problems being solved repeatedly
- Lack of developer agency
- "Feature" work that's just churn being completed due to having the resource and needing to use it
- No release planning or identifiably quantas of value being delivered

## Take One of These and Call Me in the Morning?

Platform means

- Standardization
- Build-atop, rather than build-for-now (?)
- Platform allows more abstract goals, which can be used to influence priorities and claim resources
- Application releases are just that, noone else can benefit from an inconspicuous infra change behind it.
  End users don't see it, product owners struggle to explain or sell it.
  Infra becomes a cost centre.

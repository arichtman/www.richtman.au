# Decisions and Changes

- Sever the direct link between application teams and their staff
- Firmly but gently push back on work application teams are capable of completing themselves
  - Tansitional period to ease them into it, don't drop their delivery work immediately
  - Follow up by offers to assig someone to pair with them on work that's self service
  - Stong assurances that we are available, not running and hiding
  - Accept ad-hoc and urgent work, but track proportions of effort and attribute
- Major focus shift to minimum general pattern for maximum breadth of utility
  - e.g. generalizing network access stories, RBAC patterns
- Communication communication change management
  - Multi-channel
  - Announce features
  - Run workshops and demos
  - All user-level guides to have run through a pilot implementation by app team/sweng and docs updated from that

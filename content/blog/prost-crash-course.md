# Prost Crash Course

Recently, I gave a talk and the local Rust Users Group in Brisbane, Queensland.
I wouldn't want it ...swept under the RUG ;)

You can [check out the presentation here](https://arichtman.codeberg.page/prost-crash-course)
(press `s` key for speaker mode with notes).
Some of the sections extend downwards, so don't miss out on those slides.

The [source code can be found here](https://codeberg.org/arichtman/prost-crash-course).
I've left a bunch of references in the history to allow inspecting the implementation as it progresses.

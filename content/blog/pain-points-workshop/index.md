## About

This is a one-off, 3-phase short workshop, designed to build cohort cohesion, draw out pain points and crystalize actionables to manage or mitigate the pain points.

The structure is a single-diamond diverge-converge, and the style is mostly conversational.
The minimum number of participants is three, and the instructor can participate while running the workshop.

The workshop is approximately 60 - 90 minutes with no breaks, and does not have a break, but could support a short one.
The sessions are designed to be able to run in-person, though remote and hybrid should be possible.

Theme: The Wind in Our Sails

## Aims

- Gather information on what makes people tick, how they like to work, and what they don't like in/around their work

## Outcomes

- Understand what uplifts and what irks your team
- Cohort understand how to work best with each other
- Actionable process change inputs

### Lesson plan

#### Materials

- One printout sheet per-participant, see appendix for details
- Colored pencils or markers, sufficient for tables to share

### Introduction/warm up

1. Introduce the mechanics of sailing.
   Orientation of desired direction and wind dictate what you do with the sails.
   Elicit some different modes:
   - Tailwind
   - Headwind (requires [tacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacking_(sailing)))
   - Crosswind
   - Becalmed (no wind)
   Leave some visuals up as a reminder for the next phase.
1. Share a story of yours about sailing.
1. Encourage them to share any sailing or maritime stories.

### Generation

Distribute the worksheets.
Solo, each person draws, using the colored pencils/markers, what that feels like for them to navigate that situation or when that happens.
The drawing is timed, approximately 30-40 seconds per scenario on the sheet.

Not every scenario needs to be completed, participants will often find something to say later anyway.

Encourage free-form creativity, you can draw sunshine, rainbows, hurricanes, fog, rain, waves, other boats - not just wind in the initial archetypes.

If incorporating a break, take it now.

### Discussion and distillation

Groups come back together, and take turns sharing a scenario, what they drew to represent it, and why.

Selection can be whichever one you feel strongly about, find most interesting, or want to discuss - not particularly prescriptive.

During discussion, the group notes anything they agree on or that generates significant discussion.

### Actionable conversion

Gather each group's selected scenarios and pain points on a whiteboard or similar.
Run a plenary brainstorm about how we can make the good ones happen more and manage the negative ones.

Consolidate actionables to take away that and integrate into process changes.

## Appendix: Worksheet

One white A4 page, with a grid of various sailboat sketches on it.
Underneath each sailboat is a short description of a work scenario.
The sailboats should be suitable for coloring-in, and have some space around to draw in.

Example scenarios:

- You get lots of feedback on Merge Request/Pull Request
- You finish a long and productive Slack call
- You finish writing a feature
- You get an alert/page about a system outage
- Receiving an email with a detailed request
- You're in a meeting with lots of people
- Friday
- You've been working on a problem for hours
- Someone slacks you to chat
- You're asked to review an Merge Request/Pull Request
- You have a scheduled meeting/call after dinner
- You have to present something to the office
- You're praised in public
- Monday
- Someone thanks you for your work in private
